# Xinu OS for AVR atmega328p (Arduino)

## What is Xinu?

Xinu stands for Xinu Is Not Unix -- 

Xinu is a small, elegant, and easy to understand complete operating system,
originally developed by Douglas Comer for instructional purposes at
Purdue University in the 1980s.

Xinu supports dynamic process creation, dynamic memory allocation, network communication, local and remote file systems, a shell, and device-independent I/O functions. Since the whole source code size is small, Xinu is suitable 
for embedded systems.

Xinu arranges  the  components  of  the system into a hiearchy of
layers, clarifying the interaction between the various  components 
of the system and making the system easier to understand 
and modify.  Despite its small size, Xinu uses  powerful  
primitives  to provide the same functionality many con-
ventional operating systems supply.

Xinu originally ran on  Digital  Equipment  Corporation
LSI  11's with only 64K bytes of memory, at the end of 1979 
and the inning of 1980. Over the years Xinu versions 
Xinu have been expanded and ported to a wide variety of architectures and platforms, including: IBM PC, 
Macintosh, Digital Equipment Corporation VAX and DECStation 3100, Sun Microsystems Sun 2, 
Sun 3 and Sparcstations, and for several ARM, MIPS and x86 embedded boards.
It has been used as the basis for many research projects. 
Furthermore, Xinu has been used as an embedded system in products 
by companies such as Motorola, Mitsubishi, Hewlett-Packard, and Lexmark. 
There is a full TCP/IP stack, and even the original version of Xinu 
(for the PDP-11) supported arbitrary processes and network I/O.
have  been  ported

There are current versions of Xinu for Galileo Intel boards,
ARM Beagle Boards, several MIPS platforms, and for x86 PC hardware 
and virtual machines.

Xinu differs completely
from the internal structure of Unix (or Linux). 
Xinu is smaller, elegant, and easier to understand.
Applications written for one system will not
run on the other without modification. Xinu is not Unix.

## Xinu OS for AVR atmega328p

This version of Xinu runs on AVR atmega328 microcontroller,
which just provides 2KB of RAM, 32KB of Flash memory and 1KB of EEPROM.
This port of Xinu uses 17KB of FLASH and 0.9KB of RAM, so there
are still resources (SRAM and FLASH) available for developing 
an embedded system solution programming 
concurrent processes under a real operating system; using for example,
an Arduino hardware and the Xinu operating system inside.

Xinu is easy of understand, so a developer can obtain a copy 
of the system to examine, modify,
instrument, measure, extend, or transport it to another architecture.

## Douglas Comer

Douglas Comer is a Professor of Computer Science at Purdue University who
was inducted into the Internet Hall of Fame on September, 2019.

As one of the earliest TCP/IP and internetworking researchers, Comer wrote the first series of textbooks explaining the scientific principles underlying the design of the Internet and its communications protocols, providing some of the earliest formal guidance for building efficient networks and applications that use the Internet. 

Comerâ€™s three-volume textbook series, Internetworking with TCP/IP, written in 1987, is widely considered to be the authoritative reference for Internet protocols. The series played a key role in popularizing Internet protocols by making them more understandable to a new generation of engineers and IT professionals. 

Version 6 Xinu, as
it was called, supplied primitives to handle memory  manage-
ment,          process          management,          process
coordination/synchronization,  interprocess   communication,
real-time clock management, device drivers, and intermachine
communication (a ring network).  Version 7 Xinu replaced the


## What is Xinu for STM32
Xinu for STM32 is a port of the ARM version of Xinu. The STM32 family of 32-bit microcontrollers is a popular SoC based on the Arm Cortex-M processor.
Besides porting the original version, Xinu for STM32 is extended with the following specific Cortex-M* features:

* Shadowed Stack Pointer:  Two stack pointers are available. The MSP is used
for the OS Kernel and interrupt handlers. The PSP is used by application
tasks.
* PendSV exception for scheduling: If Xinu decides that context switching is needed,
it sets the pending status of the PendSV, and delays the context-switching
request until all other IRQ handlers have completed their processing before 
carrying out the PendSV exception 

## Supported Peripherals (currently)
* UART (Serial)
* GPIO
* SPI

## Tested boards
1. STM32F103* - https://stm32-base.org/boards/STM32F103RCT6-STM32-Mini-V2.0
2. Qemu for STM32 - https://github.com/beckus/qemu_stm32

## How to build and run
Xinu for STM32 uses simple Makefiles. The source code should be compiled with a cross compiler (i.e. Ubuntu's standard package: GCC cross compiler for ARM Cortex-A/R/M processors)
STM32Flash (https://sourceforge.net/projects/stm32flash) can be used for flashing the compiled code to the device's flash ROM. Use `qemu make` to run Xinu for STM32 in Qemu. Please note that this version of qemu should be manually build (see https://github.com/beckus/qemu_stm32)
